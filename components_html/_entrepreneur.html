        <p>
          A medtech company based in Ulm, Germany, to fight shoulder and neck pain. To do so, we were developing an AI high-tech sensor which detects un-physiological posture.
          </br></br>
          We iterated towards an optimal business model. As CFO my responsibilities were budgeting, financial forecasts / monitoring and financing.
          </br></br>
          My further tasks were:
          </br>
          Building the business model, strategy and organization, pitching to investors and customer acquisition (B2B). In the end, I could attract a 200K financing.
