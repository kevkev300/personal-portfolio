      <h3> Couch Hero #HackTheCrisis </h3>
      <p>
        Taking part in #HackTheCrisisDK, we developed a prototype of a helper AI to answer questions about the corona virus. You can chat with it and even call.
        <br><br>
        Just consider, that this was developed in only 48 hours with a team that did not know each other prior the the hackathon. Still, I think we could show a nice idea.
        <br><br>
        My part in it was mainly developing the API to Google's Dialogflow AI so we could offer dynamic answers depending on the user's question. And of course some ideation and market strategy.

      <h3> eFairSorger Payroll Panel </h3>
      <p>
        In this project I develop an online app for internal use. It automates the payroll for our consultants at my first startup.
        <br><br>
        I am using ruby on rails as a framework. It involves the roo gem to upload and read excel files, the wicked_pdf gem to be able to create very dynamically pdf files to download and I needed to build quite a heavy back-end logic.
        <br><br>
        Further, an API (microservices style) needed to be developed on both sides which led me also to dive into php.
